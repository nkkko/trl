<Cat :size="140" mood="lovestruck" color="#f4a261" />

<!-- Throughout my career, I have always been a translator - not just between languages, but between complex ideas and their understanding. From general public to high level stakeholders. From academia to business and other way around. From labs to products on shelves. My numbers are milions. From 35 m of spent EU funding, to 10ths of mil of emails. -->

# AI is OLD

"We propose that a **2-month, 10-man study** of artificial intelligence be carried out during the **summer of 1956** at Dartmouth College [...]

We think that a **significant advance** can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer."

<!-- This which makes no sense. Why did it do this?

Because this is normally a riddle that examines gender bias. It’s seen thousands and thousands of versions of this riddle, and it can’t get out of that lane. It goes based on what’s in that training data.

I like this example because it kind of punctures straight through the mystique around these things. They really are just imitating what they’ve seen before.

### Basic Prompting Techniques

<div class="ns-c-tight">

- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Generating responses without providing examples or prior context
- **One-Shot Prompting**: Extracting responses based on a single example or piece of context
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Using multiple examples to guide the model's responses
</div>

:: right ::

### Advanced Techniques

<div class="ns-c-tight">

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Breaking down complex problems into sequential steps
- **Chain of Cause (CoC)**: A variation of CoT that focuses on causal relationships and reasoning
- **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)**: Extends CoT by exploring multiple coherent units of text as intermediate steps
- **Prompt Reframing**: Modifying prompt wording while maintaining original intent to generate varied responses
- **Prompt Combination**: Merging multiple instructions into a single prompt
- **Iterative Prompting**: Building upon previous responses through follow-up questions to gather detailed information
- **Active Prompting**: Active learning through 4 stages: uncertainty estimation, selection, annotation, and model adaptation
- **ReAct (Reason and Act)**: Combines reasoning and acting to solve language reasoning and decision-making tasks
