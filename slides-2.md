# The AI Hype Train
"AI isn't magic - it's a powerful tool waiting to be understood and used effectively."

<div class="text-xl">
From tech transfer to developer tools: a journey in communication
</div>

**Speaker Notes:**

*   There's a lot of hype around AI, and for good reason. But let's move beyond the buzzwords.
*   My background spans various fields – tech transfer, project management, food industry, dietary supplements, service provisioning, and now developer tools.
*   The common thread?  Communication and translation – making complex ideas understandable. AI is the next evolution in this journey.

The common thread: Communication & Translation

**Speaker Notes:**

*   As you can see, my career path has been diverse.
*   Each role demanded the ability to convey complex information clearly and effectively, whether it was scientific research, product benefits, or technical specifications.
*   This experience has given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities in communication. AI is now a crucial part of that perspective.

# My AI-Powered Life

Daily AI Applications:
- Writing: Resignation letters, complaints, documentation
- Creation: Card game development
- Coding: Programming assistance
- Communication: Translating complex ideas

"Every day, AI helps me translate complex ideas into clear communication."

**Speaker Notes:**

*   Let's get practical. How do I use AI daily?
*   **Writing:** From professional documents like resignation letters and complaints (yes, even to car dealerships!) to clear documentation.
*   **Creation:**  I even used AI to structure a real-life card game from scattered ideas.
*   **Coding:**  AI has been invaluable in learning to code, providing assistance and accelerating my progress.
*   **Communication:** It's my go-to tool for translating complex ideas into easily digestible content. AI is already integrated into my workflow, making me more efficient and effective.

# Today's Question

"Why *today* are we talking about AI in science communication?"

The timing has never been more critical.

**Speaker Notes:**

*   So, why this focus on AI in science communication *now*?
*   The tools are mature, accessible, and increasingly powerful.
*   The need for effective science communication is more urgent than ever, given complex global challenges and the spread of misinformation. We can't afford to wait.

# What is AI, Really?

"AI doesn't understand - it predicts the next most likely word with stunning accuracy."

Simon Willison: "Artificial Intelligence" vs. "Imitation Intelligence"

**Speaker Notes:**

*   Let's demystify AI a bit. Simon Willison makes a great distinction between "Artificial Intelligence" and "Imitation Intelligence."
*   Think of it as advanced autocomplete. It's incredibly good at predicting the next word, sentence, or even piece of code, based on patterns it's learned from vast amounts of data.
*   It's not sentient; it doesn't "understand" in the human sense. It's a powerful tool, but we need to understand its limitations.

# The Hallucination Problem

"The most confident answers are sometimes the most wrong."

::right::

Key Challenges:
- Fabricated information
- Confident incorrectness
- Need for verification

**Speaker Notes:**

*   One major challenge is AI's tendency to "hallucinate" – to confidently fabricate information.
*   This is because it's optimized for coherence, not necessarily truth. It can sound very convincing while being completely wrong.
*   This poses a significant problem in science communication, where accuracy is paramount. We'll discuss strategies to mitigate this risk.

# Ethics and Training Data

"AI inherits both the wisdom and biases of its training data."

Considerations:
- Data sources
- Inherent biases
- Ethical implications
- Responsibility in usage

**Speaker Notes:**

*   AI models are trained on massive datasets, which can contain biases reflecting societal prejudices and inaccuracies.
*   This means AI can inadvertently perpetuate harmful stereotypes or spread misinformation.
*   We need to be critical of the data used to train these models and aware of the ethical implications of their use. Responsible use is key.

# Measuring Effectiveness

"What makes communication effective isn't just accuracy - it's engagement."

**Speaker Notes:**

*   Evaluating AI's effectiveness in science communication isn't always straightforward. It's not just about whether the information is correct.
*   Engagement matters. Can the AI make complex topics interesting and accessible? Does it resonate with the target audience?
*   We often rely on a sense of "vibes" – how well does the model perform in a specific context and for a particular task? This requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessment.

# Current AI Capabilities

- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini

::right::

Capabilities:
- Million+ tokens
- Creative writing
- Brainstorming
- Transcription

**Speaker Notes:**

*   Today's leading language models, like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, offer impressive capabilities.
*   They can process vast amounts of text (millions of tokens), generate creative content, help with brainstorming, and even transcribe audio.
*   These are powerful tools, but it's about choosing the right one for the job.

# AI as a Creativity Enhancer

"AI turns brainstorming from a spark into a wildfire."

Applications:
- Idea generation
- Perspective expansion
- Rapid prototyping
- Concept exploration

**Speaker Notes:**

*   Think of AI not just as a productivity tool, but also as a creativity enhancer.
*   It can help generate ideas, offer different perspectives, facilitate rapid prototyping, and explore new concepts.
*   AI can take a small spark of inspiration and turn it into a flood of creative possibilities.

# Effective Prompt Engineering

"The right prompt turns AI from a smart calculator into a collaborative partner."

Structure:
1. System message
2. User input
3. Assistant response

**Speaker Notes:**

*   Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the full potential of AI.
*   A well-crafted prompt guides the AI to produce the desired output.
*   Think about structuring your prompts with:
    *   **System message:** Sets the context and instructions.
    *   **User input:** The specific question or request.
    *   **Assistant response:**  The AI's output.
*   Iterative refinement of prompts is key.
